# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an analysis that looked at how the data differs by city type, in order to allow for more data-driven business decisions. 

## Results 
The Urban city type had the highest volume of rides and drivers however, it had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Despite the lower averages, the urban cities still generateing a signficant amount more revenue than both Rural and Suburban cities. Suburban city types came in second, followed by Rural city types, which had the lowest volume of rides, drivers, and total fares. However, the Rural city type had a significantly higher average fare per Driver, indicating that these rides were of a much longer distance. 

## Summary  
### Urban City Market
The Urban cities have far too many drivers - In fact, they have more total drivers than rides which would indicate that they are possibly losing money by in more ways than one. Although the total revenue is the highest, supply outweighs the demand, driving prices much lower than may be necessary. Also, since the demand does seem to be high in Urban areas, and a large quantity of drivers would still be needed, there may be room to increase the rates, wild mildly decreasing the driver count to make these areas more profitable. 
### Seasonal Demands
Across all city types, there seems to be a possible peak in demand in the 3rd-4th week of February. With that in mind, more drivers would be needed at that time.
### Rural City Market
Based on the assumption that all city types have the same rates, it may be a good idea to try to obtain more drivers in rural areas. The average fare per driver is significantly higher indicating that each ride consists of a further distance. If drivers cannot be more readily available on demand, it may be smart to analyze how many opportunities were missed due to an inavailability of drivers. The
